# Fields

Fields are synonymous to table columns. To add fields to a model, assign an
object to [Model.fields](api/model.md#modelfields):

```js
class User extends Model {}
User.fields = { fieldName: fieldConfig };
```

You can also use a getter function to return the model's fields, but first add
the fields to the model's config to ensure they are linked to the model and that
[field inheritance](#field-inheritance) is maintained:

```js
class User extends Model {
  static get fields {
    this.config.fields = { fieldName: fieldConfig };
    return this.config.fields;
  }
}
```

!> field names should be unique, also the `Model.fields` setter will throw if
the field name is already a `Model.prototype` property or is already added as a
[virtual](guides/virtuals.md#virtuals).

Knorm uses field names as column names when running queries. To transform field
names to different column names (e.g. snake-casing), use a `fieldToColumn`
mapping function (ref. [Knorm options](api/knorm.md#options)) or specify a
different `column` name per field with the [field config](#field-config).

## Field config

Field config can be a string or an object. If it's a string, it indicates the
field's type:

```js
class User extends Model {}
User.fields = { firstName: 'string' };
```

For object configs, these options are supported:

| Option       | Type                        | Default        | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `default`    | any / function              | none           | A default value to use during insert operations if the field has no value. If configured as a function, it will be called with `this` set to the model instance.                         |
| `column`     | string                      | the field name | The column name to use for this field during database operations. **NOTE:** this takes precedence over the value returned by the `fieldToColumn` mapping function.                       |
| `primary`    | boolean                     | `false`        | Whether or not the field is the primary field. **NOTE:** a model can only have one primary field, any subsequent primary fields will overwrite the existing one (also in child models).  |
| `unique`     | boolean                     | `false`        | Whether or not the field is a unique field. Primary and unique fields are used for instance operations i.e. fetch, update, delete etc                                                    |
| `methods`    | boolean                     | `false`        | If either `primary` or `unique` is `true`, this specifies whether or not to add `fetchByField`, `updateByField` and `deleteByField` static methods to the model.                         |
| `updated`    | boolean                     | `true`         | Whether or not this field should be included in the data to be updated during update operations. Intended for use with unique and primary fields.                                        |
| `references` | [Field](api/field.md#field) | none           | A field that this field references (indicating that this field is a foreign field). Used for [relations](guides/relations.md#relations).                                                 |

## Field inheritance

In knorm, a model's fields (and virtuals) are cloned and inherited when the model
is inherited. This allows you to add more fields to the child model without
modifying the parent's fields, overwrite fields defined in the parent and
eliminates the need to re-configure common fields for every model.

To overwrite a field in a child model, add a field with the same name as the
field you wish to overwrite. You can

```js
class User extends Model {}
User.fields = {
  id: { type: 'integer', primary: true },
  names: { type: 'string' }
};

class Employee extends User {}
Employee.fields = { id: { type: 'uuid', primary: false } };

console.log(User.fields); // => { id, names }
console.log(User.fields.id.type); // 'integer'
console.log(User.primary); // 'id'
console.log(Employee.fields); // { id, names }
console.log(Employee.fields.id.type); // 'uuid'
console.log(Employee.primary); // throws 'Employee: no primary field configured'
```

## Primary and unique fields

Knorm uses primary and unique fields to find a row in the database for fetch,
update and delete operations. Every model must be at least one primary field and
can have multiple unique fields.

!> Composite/multiple primary fields are not currently supported. If two fields
are configured as primary, only the latter will be configured as a primary field.

If a field is configured as primary or unique, you may also want to prevent it
from being updated (with the `updated` option), or you can also add static
methods for fetching, updating and deleting rows by that field (with the
`methods` option). Note that `methods` only works if the field is either primary
or unique:

```js
class User extends Model {}
User.fields = {
  id: { type: 'integer', primary: true, updated: false, methods: true }
};

// User now has these static methods:
User.fetchById(id, options);
User.updateById(id, data, options);
User.deleteById(id, options);
```

> The method names are resolved by upper-casing the first letter of the field
> name and taking the rest of the field name as is

## Value casting

You can configure `forSave` and `forFetch` cast functions for every field. These
are handy for type-casting or some other functionality. For example, in
PostgreSQL you can configure a `forSave` cast function to
[stringify JSON arrays](http://knexjs.org/#Schema-json):

```js
class User extends Model {}
User.fields = {
  data: {
    type: 'json',
    cast: {
      forSave(value) {
        if (value) {
          return JSON.stringify(value);
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
```

!> &bull; `forSave` cast functions are called before validation <br />
&bull; cast functions are not called if the field's value is `undefined`, but
are called if it's `null`
