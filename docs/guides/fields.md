# Fields

Fields are synonymous to table columns. To add fields to a model, assign an
object to [Model.fields](/api.md#model-fields-object):

```js
class User extends Model {}
User.fields = { fieldName: fieldConfig };
```

You can also use a getter function to return the model's fields, but first add
the fields to the model's config to ensure they are linked to the model and that
[field inheritance](#field-inheritance) is maintained:

```js
class User extends Model {
  static get fields {
    this.config = { fields: { fieldName: fieldConfig } };
    return this.config.fields;
  }
}
```

::: warning NOTE
Field names should be unique. The `Model.fields` setter will throw if a field
name is already a `Model.prototype` property or is already added as a
[virtual](/guides/virtuals.md#virtuals).
:::

Knorm uses field names as column names when running queries. To transform field
names to different column names (e.g. snake-casing), use a `fieldToColumn`
mapping function (ref. [Knorm options](/api.md#new-knorm-config)) or specify a
different `column` name per field with the [field config](#field-config).

## Field config

Field config can be a string or an object. If it's a string, it indicates the
field's type:

```js
class User extends Model {}
User.fields = { firstName: 'string' };
```

For object configs, these options are supported:

| Option       | Type                        | Default        | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`       | string (**required**)       | none           | See [field types](#field-types).                                                                                                                                                         |
| `default`    | any / function              | none           | A default value to use during insert operations if the field has no value. If configured as a function, it will be called with `this` set to the model instance.                         |
| `column`     | string                      | the field name | The column name to use for this field during database operations. **NOTE:** this takes precedence over the value returned by the `fieldToColumn` mapping function.                       |
| `primary`    | boolean                     | `false`        | Whether or not the field is the primary field. **NOTE:** a model can only have one primary field, any subsequent primary fields will overwrite the existing one (also in child models).  |
| `unique`     | boolean                     | `false`        | Whether or not the field is a unique field. Primary and unique fields are used for instance operations i.e. fetch, update, delete etc                                                    |
| `methods`    | boolean                     | `false`        | If `true`, this adds `fetchByField`, `updateByField` and `deleteByField` static methods to the model. See [generated methods](#generated-methods)                                        |
| `updated`    | boolean                     | `true`         | Whether or not this field should be included in the data to be updated during update operations. Intended for use with unique and primary fields.                                        |
| `references` | [Field](api/field.md#field) | none           | A field that this field references (indicating that this field is a foreign field). Used for [relations](guides/relations.md#relations).                                                 |
| `cast`       | object                      | none           | An object with `forSave` or `forFetch` (or both) functions that are called with the field value to cast it to something else before save (insert and update) and after fetch operations. |

## Field inheritance

In knorm, a model's fields (and virtuals) are cloned and inherited when the model
is inherited. This:

* allows adding more fields to the child model without modifying the parent's
  fields
* allows overwriting fields defined in the parent
* eliminates the need to re-configure common fields for every model.

To overwrite a field in a child model, add a field with the same name as the
field you wish to overwrite.

```js
class User extends Model {}
User.fields = {
  id: { type: 'integer', primary: true },
  names: { type: 'string' }
};

class Employee extends User {}
Employee.fields = { id: { type: 'uuid', primary: false } };

console.log(User.fields); // => { id, names }
console.log(User.fields.id.type); // 'integer'
console.log(User.primary); // 'id'
console.log(Employee.fields); // { id, names }
console.log(Employee.fields.id.type); // 'uuid'
console.log(Employee.primary); // throws 'Employee: no primary field configured'
```

## Primary and unique fields

Knorm uses primary and unique fields to find a row in the database for fetch,
update and delete operations. Every model must have at least one primary field
but can have multiple unique fields.

::: warning NOTE
Composite/multiple primary fields are not currently supported. If two fields are
configured as primary, only the latter will be configured as a primary
field.
:::

If a field is configured as primary or unique, you may also want to prevent it
from being updated (with the `updated` option). Note that this options only works
for fields that are either primary or unique:

```js
class User extends Model {}
User.fields = {
  id: { type: 'integer', primary: true, updated: false },
  names: 'string'
};

const user = await new User.insert({ id: 1, names: 'Foo' });

user.names = 'Bar';

await user.update(); // `id` will not be sent in the update query
```

## Generated methods

You can configure static methods for fetching, updating and deleting rows by a
field to be added to the model with the `methods` option:

```js
class User extends Model {}
User.fields = {
  id: { type: 'integer', methods: true },
  firstName: { type: 'string', methods: true }
};

// User will now have these static methods:
User.fetchById(id, options);
User.updateById(id, data, options);
User.deleteById(id, options);

User.fetchByFirstName(firstName, options);
User.updateByFirstName(firstName, data, options);
User.deleteByFirstName(firstName, options);
```

> `options` are optional for all the methods

The method names are resolved by upper-casing the first letter of the field name
and taking the rest of the field name as is.

::: tip INFO
Since these methods are intended to work with a single row, they will
automatically throw a `NoRowsFetchedError`, `NoRowsUpdatedError` or
`NoRowsDeletedError` error if the row is not found in the database.
:::

## Value casting

You can configure `forSave` and `forFetch` cast functions for every field. These
are handy for type-casting or some other functionality:

```js
class User extends Model {}
User.fields = {
  data: {
    type: 'email',
    cast: {
      forSave(value) {
        if (value) {
          return value.toLowerCase();
        }
      },
      forFetch(value) {
        if (value) {
          return value.replace('@', '[at]');
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
```

> `forSave` refers to both insert and update operations

::: tip INFO
`forSave` cast functions are called **after** validation. This allows specifying
some field-type in the field's configuration while the database stores the
values with a different type, if needed.
:::

::: tip INFO
Cast functions are not called if the field's value is `undefined`, but are
called if it's `null`.
