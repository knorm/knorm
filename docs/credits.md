Knorm is inspired by the [Mongoose JS](http://mongoosejs.com/) and
[Bookshelf.js](http://bookshelfjs.org/) APIs.

It was previously built as a wrapper around [Knex.js](http://knexjs.org), hence
the name "kn-orm", that is knex-orm. It no longer depends on Knex, instead it
now builds it's own SQL via [SQL Bricks.js](http://csnw.github.io/sql-bricks/).

Thank you [Ramsés Cabello](https://twitter.com/ramsescabello) for the logo.
